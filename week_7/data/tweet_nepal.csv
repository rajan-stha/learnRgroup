"People of #India, #Pakistan &amp; #Nepal should #fast together to help resolve their conflicts, avoid violence &amp; war. People of #Kashmir are in siege, curfew, their youth being killed for asking right of self determination. Innocent Kashmiris are sandwiched between 2 nuclear nations"
#India &amp; #Nepal need to solve border dispute with dialogue. Both nations share cultural values &amp; majority population of both is peaceful. Hijack of India by right wing #RSS extremists is cause of oppression of #Dalits/ #Christians &amp; minorities &amp; problems with neighboring nations.

#Maldives come to our support when #Nepal sold themselves to traitors a d Communist #china https://t.co/waiS4Li4qY
@newaboy4 @TiwariNivedita Educated (whatever little) Nepalese should ask their government - why they did not attempt a diplomatic solution before going public inspite of knowing well that this will only make the dispute more complicated? The answer is simple - #Nepal govt did not want a solution!!
@newaboy4 @TiwariNivedita What #Nepal communist government may do now is try to further inflame the situation - push India to the brink without caring for what it will do the common poor citizen. Unfortunately the young generation of Nepal is unable to overcome their shortsightedness. Chinese loving it.
@newaboy4 @TiwariNivedita #Nepal government’s behaviour showed it was using its people’s patriotic emotions to create a public fight with India in a manner it would be difficult for the neighbour to negotiate. communists will not hesitate to sacrifice its people for the sake of agenda just like in India
@newaboy4 @TiwariNivedita There are many aspects of this dispute which show clearly the negative intent of the #Nepal communist govt. Nepalese citizens should understand - first their religion was taken away - now their religious connection attacked - like Pakistan they will be soon made a Chinese slave.
@newaboy4 @TiwariNivedita One of the big achievements of Modi was resolution of border disputes pending for decades. India gave away more than 10000 acres of land to Bangladesh in order to resolve the issue. When it could have this approach with a Islamic country - why would it not resolve with #Nepal ?
